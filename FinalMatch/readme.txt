Final Match @ Maker Faire Rome 2017. keyword: DOMOTIC

We won this championship!

Smartattack team presents MeMo: an artificial house steward which helps you to manage house power consumptions. 

- Each room has several input (sensors, pushbuttons etc.) and outputs (automatic windows, lights, boiler, oven, air conditioner etc.).
- The user can read input and manage output using a smartphone app.
- The steward reads all the informations and interacts with the user using a synthetic voice, to give advices, reminders and warning about power consumptions.

What we used:

2 Arduino UNO, sensors, servomotors, leds and a laptop running python 3. The app has been developed using Blynk (USB-serial version).
