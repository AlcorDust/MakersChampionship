# MakersChampionship
Source codes from Italian University Makers Championship ( https://www.facebook.com/CampUniMakers/ ), made by Smartattack Team (me and Daniele Cerioni). The first session was @ Roma Tre University: we built a crowd manager for museums. The final session was @ Maker Faire Rome 2017: we created a domotic voice assistant (+ smartphone app) which helps the user to manage power consumptions. We won as Roma Tre University Students against other Italian Universities. Use the code as you want, but remember to mention us!
