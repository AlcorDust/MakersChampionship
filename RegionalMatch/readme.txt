Smartattack team presents the Crowd Manager: a cheap and easy to use tool to manage visitors in museums. 
Each visitor has an IR emitter installed inside the voice guide device (powered by headphone jack) which transmits every second its ID number. 

Each museum room has a sentinel which consists in an IR receiver. It reads the visitor ID and sends it to the server.

The server keeps the visitor's count and handle the people flux through automatic doors. The doors are activated creating always new paths inside the museum, keeping the number of visitors in each room as low as possible.

The server shows on a display the map of the museum with visitors and doors indicators, changing states in real-time.

What we used:

2 Arduino UNO with IR leds, IR receivers, 2 servomotors, a laptop with Processing script.
